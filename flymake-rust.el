;;
;; If you want to use rustc compiler, you must add following string:

;;
;; Uses flymake-easy, from https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy

;;; Code:

(require 'flymake-easy)

(defconst flymake-rust-err-line-patterns
  '(("^\\(.*\\)\n   --> \\(.*.rs\\):\\([0-9]+\\):\\([0-9]+\\)$" 2 3 4 1)
    ("^\\(.*.rs\\):\\([0-9]+\\):[0-9]+: [0-9]+:[0-9]+ [a-z]+: \\(.*\\)$" 1 2 nil 3)
    ("^\\(.*.rs\\):\\([0-9]+\\) \\(.*\\)$" 1 2 nil 3)))

(setq-default flymake-rust-use-cargo 1)

(if flymake-rust-use-cargo
    (defvar flymake-rust-executable "cargo"
      "The rust executable to use for syntax checking.")
    (defvar flymake-rust-executable "rustc"
      "The rust executable to use for syntax checking.")
)

;; Invoke rust "--parse-only" to get syntax checking
(defun flymake-rust-command (filename)
  "Construct a command that flymake can use to check rust source."
  (if flymake-rust-use-cargo
      (list flymake-rust-executable "build")
      (list flymake-rust-executable "--no-trans" filename)
      )

;; Load rust-flymake
(defun flymake-rust-load ()
  "Configure flymake mode to check the current buffer's rust syntax."
  (interactive)
  (flymake-easy-load 'flymake-rust-command
                     flymake-rust-err-line-patterns
